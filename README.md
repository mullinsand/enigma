Functionality
4/4 - CLI works and cracking method works

OOP
3.5/4 - Multiple modules made, explored doing other classes but had no need for state anywhere else. Could've made enigma a little less complicated

Ruby conventions and Mechanics
3.5/4 - 3ish methods greater than 10 lines (12 lines max?), have a hash, naming conventions are good but not great. Tried to use the best enumerables and data structures.

TDD
4/4 - Extensive use of testing with stubs and 100% test coverage.

Version Control
3.5/4 - Had 42 commits and 14 PR's but they were not all logically named or covering the same purposes. Multiple pieces of functionality committed sometimes.
